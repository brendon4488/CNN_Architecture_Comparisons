    "This preprocessing pipeline systematically transforms raw property listing data into a structured, machine-learning-ready format through three key phases:\n",
    "1. Data Validation and Cleaning, where invalid prices are filtered out and all currency values are standardized to USD to ensure consistency. Missing values in critical numerical features like bedrooms, bathrooms, and area measurements are intelligently handled using median imputation, which preserves the data distribution while handling gaps effectively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Feature Engineering,  demonstrates domain expertise in real estate analytics by creating meaningful derived features. Boolean flags (has_building, has_land) elegantly handle properties with missing area data, while ratio features (area_ratio, bed_bath_ratio) capture important property characteristics that raw measurements alone cannot express. The price_per_sqm metric provides a normalized pricing benchmark that enables fair comparisons across different property types and sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Text Processing, extracts property types from listing titles when explicit classifications are missing, ensuring no valuable information is lost. Categorical variables like location and property type are encoded numerically, making them compatible with machine learning algorithms while preserving their informational value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the standardization step ensures all features are on comparable scales, which is crucial for models sensitive to feature magnitudes. The output is a clean, well-structured dataset ready for both traditional machine learning and advanced neural network approaches.\n",

    "\n",
    "This image processing pipeline implements an innovative two-pass *median imputation* strategy that fundamentally addresses the common challenge of missing image data in real-world datasets. The approach begins with a comprehensive first pass through all property listings, systematically collecting every available valid image while intelligently handling various edge cases including missing filenames, file system errors, and corrupted images. This careful collection phase enables the computation of a dataset-wide median image that statistically represents the central tendency of all available property photographs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core innovation lies in the second pass, where every property listing receives either its actual image or the computed median as a sophisticated placeholder. This strategy ensures complete data preservation - no property is discarded due to missing images, *maintaining the statistical power of the full 1,613-sample dataset*. The median image serves as a *domain-aware default that provides more meaningful information than simple zero-padding*, as it contains realistic visual patterns and color distributions characteristic of property photographs in the Zimbabwe market.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation demonstrates robust error handling through multiple validation layers: filename sanity checks, filesystem existence verification, and loading exception management. Comprehensive status tracking provides transparency into the loading process, enabling quality assessment and potential troubleshooting. The final output maintains perfect alignment between image data and tabular features, ensuring that machine learning models can learn from both data modalities without introducing biases from missing visual information."
